# Note
This repository only incorporates OGGEncoder from the fork source Swift-Ogg. All other features have been removed.

# swift-ogg
This library provides a very simple API to convert between `opus/ogg` and `MPEG4AAC/m4a` files.
It uses opus's `libopus` `libogg` to convert between `opus/ogg` and linear PCM audio data and native iOS apis to convert between PCM and `MPEG4AAC/m4a`(but could be very easily adapted to use any other codec/container supported by iOS).
Apple's recording and playback APIs from `AVFoundation` can then be used quite simply with a codec/container pair that iOS natively supports (`MPEG4AAC/m4a` in this case).

# Usage
  ```swift
      let src:URL = ...
      let dest:URL = ...
      let dest2:URL = ...
      do {
          // Convert to OGG
          try OGGConverter.convertM4aFileToOpusOGG(src: src, dest: dest)
          // And back to M4a
          try OGGConverter.convertOpusOGGToM4aFile(src: dest, dest: dest2)
      } catch {
          // handle error
      }
  ```
